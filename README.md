# cat-clicker
This is a version of the game Cow Clicker. In the original version you get an image of a cow that you can click every 6 hours. 
The goal of the game is to get as many clicks as possibles. 

# Why this game
I created this game as project for my Udacity Nanodegree. The main goal was to create it using JavaScript only and to learn how to build
and MVC structure from scratch. 

# How to Play
1. Select a cat from the list on the left hand side. 
2. Click on the cat and watch the clickCounts go up. 
3. Click on Admin button to edit cat image, name or clickCount manually.
